# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Discovering Patterns in Student Performance Data

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **systematic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** workflow to understand an unfamiliar dataset and extract meaningful insights. Using Python’s data science ecosystem, the analysis explores data structure, distributions, outliers, and relationships between variables to identify factors influencing student academic performance.

The project follows a **six-stage EDA framework** and applies both **statistical summaries and visualizations** to uncover patterns before any predictive modeling.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the structure and quality of an unfamiliar dataset  
- Perform univariate and bivariate analysis  
- Detect outliers and anomalies  
- Identify correlations between academic factors  
- Generate insights to guide further analysis or modeling

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset represents **500 students** with the following variables:

| Column Name        | Description |
|--------------------|------------|
| StudentID          | Unique student identifier |
| Age                | Student age |
| StudyHours         | Weekly study hours |
| AttendanceRate     | Attendance percentage |
| PreviousGPA        | GPA from previous term |
| CurrentGPA         | Current term GPA |
| Major              | Student’s academic major |

> ⚠️ Note: The dataset used in this project is **synthetically generated** for academic demonstration purposes.
